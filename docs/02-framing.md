# Framing

> Frame the job clearly (one sentence)

## Why Framing?
A clear job-to-be-done statement keeps you focused on the real outcome, not features.

## Steps
1. **Write a one-sentence job statement**
2. **Validate with real users**
3. **Refine until clear and actionable**

## Template
- [job-to-be-done.md](../templates/job-to-be-done.md)
