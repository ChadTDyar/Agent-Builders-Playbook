# Discovery

> Find tasks worth automating (evidence-required)

## Why Discovery?
Most agents fail because they solve problems nobody actually has. Discovery is about finding real, painful, frequent tasks that are worth automating.

## Steps
1. **Observe real workflows**
2. **Collect evidence of pain/time waste**
3. **List candidate tasks**
4. **Score for frequency, pain, and value**
5. **Pick the top job to automate**
