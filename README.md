# Agent Builder's Playbook

> Stop building AI agents that die in a drawer. Ship agents people actually use.

## What This Is

A complete, evidence-based system for building AI agents that actually get used (including by you). Based on building the same agent 5 different ways and learning what works.

**Not:** Theoretical AI agent frameworks  
**Yes:** Practical playbook with real code, tests, and deployment examples

## The Problem

Most first AI agents fail. Not because the code is bad - because they solve problems you don't actually have.

This playbook teaches you to:
1. Find tasks worth automating (evidence-required)
2. Frame the job clearly (one sentence)
3. Build the thin slice (smallest viable version)
4. Test honestly (80% pass rate before shipping)
5. Ship simply (where people already work)
6. Iterate with data (fix what actually breaks)

## Quick Start

### Option 1: Read the Guide
Start with [docs/01-discovery.md](docs/01-discovery.md)

### Option 2: Use the Starter Template
```bash
cp -r starter-template my-agent
cd my-agent
# Follow the README
```

### Option 3: Study the Link Example
Full production agent: examples/link-agent/

## Real Results

Link Agent:

Built: 5 iterations over 2 months
Usage: Daily for 3+ months
Time saved: 2+ hours/week (100+ hours total)
ROI: 2x LinkedIn engagement + 1 deal closed

## The System (TL;DR)
1. Discovery → Evidence-backed task validation
2. Framing → Job-to-be-done sentence
3. Build → Thin slice, simplest tool
4. Test → 10 real cases, 80% pass rate
5. Ship → Match existing workflows
6. Iterate → Fix top failure weekly
